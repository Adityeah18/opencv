# Module 07 ‚Äì Image Filtering & Edge Detection

 **Filename:** `07_camera_filters.py`

##  What This Script Does

This Python script accesses your webcam or video file and lets you apply different filters in real time using **OpenCV**.  
It includes:

- Preview (raw feed)
- Blur (mean filter)
- Canny Edge Detection
- Shi-Tomasi Feature Detection (corner points)

|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `P`       | Preview                   | Just shows the camera feed                       |
| `B`       | Blur                      | Applies a mean filter (cv2.blur)                 |
| `C`       | Canny Edge Detection      | Detects edges using gradients                    |
| `F`       | Feature Detection         | Detects corners using Shi-Tomasi method          |
| `Q` / `Esc` | Quit                    | Closes the window                                |

##  Key Learnings

###  **Why is feature detection done in grayscale?**
Feature detectors like Shi-Tomasi rely on **pixel intensity gradients**, not color. So:
- Frame is converted using `cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`
- Detection is done on this grayscale image
- But **drawing is done on the color image**, so the circles show up in color.

###  **Why were words detected better than faces?**
- Text has **sharp corners and high contrast**
- Faces have **soft gradients** with less contrast (especially under bad lighting)
- Feature detection prefers hard edges and intensity jumps, so text wins

###  **Why were circles few and large?**
- The **number of circles** is controlled by:
  - `qualityLevel`: lower values (e.g. `0.01`) = more features
  - `minDistance`: lower values = more features allowed closer together
- The **circle size** is drawn manually:
  ```python
  cv2.circle(result, (x, y), 10, (0, 255, 0), 1)
