##  End of Line

That’s it.  
Not just the end of Module 13  but the **final checkpoint** of the whole OpenCV course.

We began with raw pixels, blurred some faces, warped a few perspectives, drew stickmen on still images, and learned how to make machines see  or at least pretend to.

And now? You’re not reading a tutorial anymore.  
You’re standing at the edge, looking at *what you can build next*.

OpenCV, these notebooks, the models, the code  it’s all here because people shared what they knew.  
Open source isn’t just about free code  it's about **lowering the entry barriers**. For devs like me. Like you. For anyone with more curiosity than compute.

Because **not everything has to be monetized**, and not every lesson needs a paywall.  
Helping others climb is still the best kind of version control.

### What Happens Now?

If this repo sparked a few neurons, good.  
If it helped you see joints where there were just pixels, even better.  
If it inspired you to fork, break, and rebuild  *perfect.*

But we’re done learning modules.

Next: **Projects**  
Where we stop asking “how does it work?” and start answering “can we make it better?”

Until then:  
Stay synced. Stay weird.  

See you beyond the matrix.
