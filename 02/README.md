# Image Manipulations – OpenCV Module 2              [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MlDwlTMb8aeqSofqynr1aC7JlxFZq0Hh?usp=sharing)

This notebook covers the fundamental operations for manipulating images using OpenCV. It is the second part of a beginner-friendly computer vision series.

## Overview

In this module, we work with image arrays directly using NumPy and OpenCV functions. Topics covered:

- Reading images in grayscale and color
- Accessing and modifying individual pixels
- Cropping regions from images
- Resizing images (with and without aspect ratio preservation)
- Flipping images (horizontal, vertical, both)
- Saving images to disk

These operations are essential for preprocessing, augmentation, and understanding how image data works under the hood.

A Python script version of this notebook is also included for direct execution outside notebooks.
