## Overview

This module demonstrates how to annotate images using OpenCV. You'll learn how to draw shapes and text on images — essential for marking regions of interest, debugging models, or preparing labeled datasets.

> A Python `.py` version of the notebook is included for standalone use.

---

## What You'll Learn

- Drawing **lines** with custom color and thickness
- Drawing **circles** and **rectangles** using pixel coordinates
- Adding **text** with OpenCV fonts
- Handling **coordinate systems** in image matrices
- Saving annotated images using `cv2.imwrite()`

---

## Files Included

- `03_annotation.ipynb` – The Colab-ready notebook
- `03_annotation.py` – Standalone Python script
- Sample annotated images:
  - `Apollo_11_Launch.jpg`
