## Overview

This repository provides a hands-on, beginner-friendly guide to **image processing using OpenCV** in Python. You'll work through a series of examples using Jupyter/Colab notebooks to understand how images are read, displayed, modified, and saved using `cv2`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

Alongside the notebook, a corresponding **Python script (`.py`) version** is also included for users who prefer working in standard Python files or integrating the code into larger projects.

> This is **Module 1** of a multi-part practical series.

## Prerequisites

To make the most of this notebook, it's recommended you review:

- [NumPy Basics](https://github.com/Adityeah18/numpy): essential for understanding how images are represented as arrays
- [Matplotlib Guide](https://github.com/Adityeah18/matplotlib): helpful for visualizing image data

---

## Topics Covered

- Loading images using OpenCV
- Checking image properties (dimensions, channels, data types)
- Viewing images as NumPy matrices
- Working with color channels (grayscale, BGR, RGB, HSV)
- Displaying images with `matplotlib`
- Saving images in different formats

## Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `01/`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ `01_intro_to_opencv.ipynb` — Main interactive notebook  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ `01_intro_to_opencv.py` — (Optional) script version if exported  
- `assets/` — Directory for image inputs (optional, if needed)
